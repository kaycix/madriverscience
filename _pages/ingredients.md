<h6>Ingredients</h6>

<ul>
<li><b>Water</b></li>
<li><b>Ethnol (INCI name: Ethyl Alcohol):</b> Used to prevent freezing in cold weather.</li>
<li><b>Texanol (INCI name: Trimethyl Hydroxypentyl Isobutyrate):</b> A chemically fierce name but with the benign and critically important function of creating tough, scratch-resistant films.</li>
<li><b>Acrylic Emulsion (INCI name: Acrylates Copolymer):</b> A film-forming acrylic polymer in the form of an emulsion, it is very similar to milk in its appearance and compatibility with water. As such, it is sensitive to the hydrolytic degradation common to all compounds that are water soluble. Thus, by definition, and in stark contrast to the brittly hard plastics that are immune to a water environment and that are polluting our oceans, our polymer is biodegradable.
</li>
<li>
<b>Dowanol DPM (INCI name: Di propylene glycol Methyl Ether ):</b> This water-soluble solvent, in contrast to the similar-sounding but distinctly structurally different di ethylene glycol methyl ether, is non-toxic and readily biodegradable.
</li>
<li>
<b>Laponite (INCI name: Sodium Magnesium Silicate):</b> A synthetic smectite clay or layered silicate commonly used in cosmetics and medical applications.
</li>
<li>
<b>FD&C Pigments:</b> Contrary to popular belief, all of the FD&C pigments including the ones we use in our polish have been proven to be non-toxic and safe for use in cosmetics.  
</li>
</ul>
